## 1 &emsp;Zed Quick Started guide 
### 1.1 Connect your camera
&emsp;&emsp;Unpack your camera, plug the camera in a USB 3.0 port and go to the next step. ZED cameras are all UVC compliant so they should be automatically recognized by your computer.

### 1.2 Download and install the ZED SDK  
&emsp;&emsp;The ZED SDK is available for Windows, Linux and Nvidia Jetson platforms. It contains all the libraries that powers your camera along with tools that let you test its features and settings.  
&emsp;&emsp;Select your platform and follow the installation guide: Windows, Linux, Jetson.  
&emsp;&emsp;Currently, we offer a companion SDK with Ubuntu version 18.04.

### 1.3 Run ZED Explorer
&emsp;&emsp;The ZED Explorer ( /usr/local/zed/tools/ZED Explorer ) is an application for ZED live preview and recording. It lets you change video resolution, aspect ratio, camera parameters, and capture high resolution snapshots and 3D video.  
&emsp;&emsp;If the ZED is recognized by your computer, you’ll see the 3D video from your camera.
